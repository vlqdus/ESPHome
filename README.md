Hi, i recently remembered i had an ESP32-WROOM-32D sitting around and collecting dust, so why not make something useful out of it?

I'm new in ESPHome and .yaml coding, but i got the hang of it. I've tested my skills with a bunch of LEDs and small DC motors, but now i want something bigger..
So i will buy a TON of HV Components, to make my house "smart".
